<img src="/assets/img/nsf-logo.png" alt="NSF" style="width:35px;"> Grateful to be part of the `$15M NSF Harnessing Data Revolution (HDR) Institute grant` on "[Imageomics](https://imageomics.osu.edu/): A New Frontier of Biological Information Powered by KGML"  (see [VT News](https://news.vt.edu/articles/2022/03/three-virginia-tech-scientists-partner-on-multi-university-grant.html) story). I am the Site PI from VT and one of the 4 co-PIs across 11 institutions involved in this project.
