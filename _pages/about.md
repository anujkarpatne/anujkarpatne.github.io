Hi, I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech (VT) where I lead the [<img src="/assets/img/logo.jpg" alt="KGML-Lab Logo" style="width:42px;">**Knowledge-guided Machine Learning (KGML) Lab**](https://kgml-lab.github.io/). I joined VT in 2018 as an Assistant Professor and received tenure in 2023. Before that, I was a PhD student at the University of Minnesota working with [Prof. Vipin Kumar](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~kumar001/) on understanding climate change using data-driven approaches. This exposed me to problems in science where there is a wealth of *scientific knowledge* available to be incorporated in machine learning (ML) algorithms to go beyond &quot;black-box&quot; applications of ML in science, giving rise to a new field of *knowledge-guided ML* (KGML).

My research vision is to establish KGML as a thriving area of research that serves as a nucleus for foundational innovations in AI/ML to produce *scientifically grounded*, *explainable*, and *generalizable* solutions, driven by *inter-disicplinary problems* in science that impact society. My lab has contributed several themes of research in KGML for incorporating scientific knowledge in ML including knowledge-guided `(KG)-Loss Functions`, `KG-Neural Architectures`, `KG-Pretraining`, and `Hybrid-Science-ML Modeling` (see [Publications](/publications/) for a categorization of papers in each theme). This has been possible thanks to the amazing set of collaborators I have been fortunate to work with from diverse scientific disciplines including *physics* (`fluid dynamics`, `quantum mechanics`, and `electromagnetism`), *environmental sciences* (`aquatic sciences`, `remote sensing`, and `geophysics`), and *biology* (`organismal biology`, `virology`, and `mechanobiology`) with generous support from NSF (see [Funding](/funding/) for a list of awards and collaborators).
