Hello everyone! I am an Associate Professor in the Department at Computer Science at Virginia Tech (VT) where I lead the **Knowledge-guided Machine Learning** Lab ([<img src="/assets/img/logo.jpg" alt="KGML-Lab Logo" style="width:42px;">KGML-Lab](https://kgml-lab.github.io/)). I joined VT as an Assistant Professor in 2018 and got tenured in 2023. Before that, I was a PhD student at the University of Minnesota working with Prof. Vipin Kumar on the Climate Change Expeditions project. This exposed me to problems in science where there is a wealth of knowledge.

Did my PhD in 2017 at UMN with Vipin Kumar. Climate Change problems. I also got the opportunity to work on the text book. Got introduced to problems in science where there is wealth of knowledge in the form of models, equations, how these models can be used to improve ML performance. This is what gave rise to KGML. Aftger joining VT in 2018. I got to build the foundations of this emerging paradigm not just for climate science but many other disciplines, laying down its different research themes. This area has seen tremendous growth in the last 6 years. I am grateful to all the collaborations I could build with experts from diverse domains and institutions who have made it possible to build the research themes of this nascent discipline, and to the support from NSF for my projects.



What is KGML.
