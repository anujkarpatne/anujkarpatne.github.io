Hello everyone! I am an Associate Professor in the Department at Computer Science at Virginia Tech (VT) where I lead the **Knowledge-guided Machine Learning** Lab ([<img src="/assets/img/logo.jpg" alt="KGML-Lab Logo" style="width:42px;">KGML-Lab](https://kgml-lab.github.io/)). I joined VT as an Assistant Professor in 2018 and got tenured in 2023. Before that, I was a PhD student at the University of Minnesota working with Prof. Vipin Kumar on the Climate Change Expeditions project. This exposed me to problems in science where there is a wealth of knowledge.

Did my PhD in 2017 at UMN with Vipin Kumar. Climate Change problems. I also got the opportunity to work on the text book. Got introduced to problems in science where there is wealth of knowledge in the form of models, equations, how these models can be used to improve ML performance. This is what gave rise to KGML. Aftger joining VT in 2018. I got to build the foundations of this emerging paradigm not just for climate science but many other disciplines, laying down its different research themes. This area has seen tremendous growth in the last 6 years. I am grateful to all the collaborations I could build with experts from diverse domains and institutions who have made it possible to build the research themes of this nascent discipline, and to the support from NSF for my projects.



What is KGML. 


See projects page. See KGML updates.



My research strives to push the capabilities of current standards of machine learning (ML) in solving scientific and societally relevant problems by developing novel methodologies in the emerging field of scientific Knowledge-guided Machine Learning (KGML). KGML seeks a distinct departure from “data-only” and “science-only” methods by using both scientific knowledge and data in the design and learning of ML models. The key motivation behind KGML is to improve the interpretability and generalization power of ML models, especially on out-of-sample distributions and even in the paucity of gold-standard data. KGML is also referred to by various names in different research communities, including ‘theory-guided data science’ (TGDS), ‘physics-guided machine learning’ (PGML), ‘science-guided machine learning’ (SGML), and ‘physics-informed machine learning’ (PIML). I enjoy working on inter-disciplinary problems and have been fortunate to work with amazing collaborators from a diverse range of scientific disciplines including lake modeling, remote sensing, geophysics, fluid dynamics, quantum mechanics, optics, radar physics, mechanobiology, and trait-based biology. If you are interested in collaborating, please feel free to contact me!

I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech, where I am also affiliated with the Sanghani Center for AI and Data Analytics. I joined as an Assistant Professor in 2018. Before that, I completed my PhD at the University of Minnesota.

My research aims to push the boundaries of KGML. I am passionate about AI for Science and the role KGML can play in this. Have been organizing workshops. Funding. Publications.

Loss functions. Architecture. Embedding. Hybrid.

See our perspective article. Also, my tutorial video.
