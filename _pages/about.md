Hello everyone! I am an Associate Professor in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.vt.edu/) at Virginia Tech (VT) where I lead the [<img src="/assets/img/logo.jpg" alt="KGML-Lab Logo" style="width:42px;">**Knowledge-guided Machine Learning (KGML) Lab**](https://kgml-lab.github.io/). I also serve as a Faculty Fellow and Dean’s Fellow in the [College of Engineering](https://eng.vt.edu/) at VT, and on leadership roles in  center-scale research projects including: *co-PI & KGML lead*  of the [$15M NSF HDR Imageomics Institute](https://imageomics.osu.edu/), *Jump Thrust co-lead*  of the [$18M NSF PIPP COMPASS Center](https://compass-pipp.org/), *site PI & KGML co-lead*  of a [$10M USDA SAS project](https://www.nifa.usda.gov/grants/programs/agriculture-food-research-initiative/afri-sustainable-agricultural-systems), *site PI and ML lead*  of the [$1.1M NSF Eco-KGML project](https://eco-kgml.github.io/), and *lead PI*  of a [$1M NSF Medium project](https://news.vt.edu/articles/2021/10/sanghani-center-researcher-receives--1-million-nsf-grant-to-pred.html).


**What is KGML?**  The goal of KGML is to incorpoate scientific knowledge in AI/ML models to make them *scientifically grounded*, *interpretable*, and *generalizable* even on *out-of-distribution* data. Starting with a [vision article in 2017](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7959606), KGML has grown into a vibrant research community spanning multiple directions, from solving partial differential equations (PDEs) to discovering governing equations, generating scientific hypotheses, and building digital twins combining physics-based and ML models. Today, KGML is leading a new paradigm in **AI for Science** while also advancing the **Science of AI** driven by the needs of problems in science and engineering. To learn more about KGML, see: [KGML book](https://sites.google.com/vt.edu/kgml-book/), [lecture recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bFEnWXCAfY&t=60s)   of a tutorial on KGML, recent [perspective article](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15989), and [keynote talk slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTmp7ODbMPfJdm5BpcniBQbC4Ecw7jE8UQyZc3TGDfErh5masbP2PTjE5FvNrs28A/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000&slide=id.p1) from a recent [KGML workshop](https://midas.umich.edu/events/kgml-workshop-leading-the-new-paradigm-of-ai-for-science/) sponsored by [Schmidt Sciences](https://www.schmidtsciences.org/).


**Focus of KGML Lab:** Our lab is advancing the frontiers of KGML by *rethinking* the assumptions that go into AI/ML models *inspired by scientific knowledge*. Our work has resulted in novel formulations for knowledge-guided `(KG)-representation learning`, `KG-loss functions`, `KG-neural architectures`, `KG-interpretable AI`, and more recently, `KG-generative AI`, `KG-foundation models`, and `KG-agentic AI` (see [Publications](/publications/) for details). Our work is highly inter-disciplinary in nature and we have been fortunate to collaborate with an amazing network of scientists spanning *environmental sciences* (`aquatic sciences`, `agriculture`, `remote sensing`, and `geophysics`), *biological sciences* (`organismal biology`, `biodiversity science`, `virology`, and `mechanobiology`), and *physical sciences* (`fluid dynamics`, `quantum mechanics`, and `electromagnetism`), with generous support from NSF and USDA (see [Funding](/funding/) for details on grants and collaborations).

<!-- KGML plays a central role in projects across ecology, agriculture, organismal biology, virology, epidemiology, and beyond.

Our lab has contributed key advances in KGML, including knowledge-guided loss functions, KG neural architectures, KG pretraining, and hybrid science–ML modeling (see Publications
 for a thematic overview).

These efforts are made possible through collaborations with an outstanding network of scientists across physics (fluid dynamics, quantum mechanics, electromagnetism), environmental sciences (aquatic sciences, remote sensing, geophysics), and biology (organismal biology, virology, mechanobiology), supported by generous funding from the NSF (see Funding
 for details).

I’m excited to see KGML continue to expand its impact, leading a new paradigm for #AI4Science, while also advancing the science of AI inspired by the needs of science and engineering.

explainable, generalizable, and scientifically grounded AI. Today, KGML is integral to several projects in AI for Science spanning ecology, agriculture, organismal biology, virology, epidemiology, and beyond.

<!-- I joined VT in 2018 as an Assistant Professor and received tenure in 2023. Before that, I was a PhD student at the University of Minnesota working with [Prof. Vipin Kumar](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~kumar001/) on understanding climate change using data-driven approaches. This exposed me to problems in science where there is a wealth of *scientific knowledge* available to be incorporated in machine learning (ML) algorithms to go beyond &quot;black-box&quot; applications of ML in science, giving rise to a new field of *knowledge-guided ML* (KGML). -->

<!-- My research vision is to establish KGML as a thriving area of research that serves as a nucleus for foundational innovations in AI/ML to produce *scientifically grounded*, *explainable*, and *generalizable* solutions, driven by *inter-disicplinary problems* in science that impact society. 

Our lab has contributed several themes of research in KGML for incorporating scientific knowledge in ML including knowledge-guided `(KG)-Loss Functions`, `KG-Neural Architectures`, `KG-Pretraining`, and `Hybrid-Science-ML Modeling` (see [Publications](/publications/) for a categorization of papers in each theme). This has been possible thanks to the amazing set of collaborators I have been fortunate to work with from diverse scientific disciplines including *physics* (`fluid dynamics`, `quantum mechanics`, and `electromagnetism`), *environmental sciences* (`aquatic sciences`, `remote sensing`, and `geophysics`), and *biology* (`organismal biology`, `virology`, and `mechanobiology`) with generous support from NSF (see [Funding](/funding/) for a list of awards and collaborators). -->
