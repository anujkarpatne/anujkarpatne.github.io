Hello everyone! I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech, where I am also affiliated with the Sanghani Center for AI and Data Analytics. I joined as an Assistant Professor in 2018. Before that, I completed my PhD at the University of Minnesota.

My research aims to push the boundaries of KGML. I am passionate about AI for Science and the role KGML can play in this. Have been organizing workshops. Funding. Publications.

Loss functions. Architecture. Embedding. Hybrid.
