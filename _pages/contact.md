Thank you for your interest in working with me. I am currently looking for undergraduate students who are already at VT or prospective PhD students. I am currently NOT in a position to take MS/MEng students. Please follow the following steps:
1. Check my lab's [webpage](https://kgml-lab.github.io/) to learn about our current research projects.
2. Fill out the following survey: [https://forms.gle/3CUEa57bAo5fjceX8](https://forms.gle/3CUEa57bAo5fjceX8).
3. Send me an email indicating that you have filled out the survey so that we can follow-up.

Please note that due to the volume of emails I receive everyday, I am unable to respond to all emails. Please keep your email short and focused to the point to make it easier for me to respond. Here is an article on [how to write effective emails](https://postgraduateeducation.hms.harvard.edu/trends-medicine/blueprint-writing-effective-emails
